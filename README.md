# hacking
This repo contains my implementations of some of the examples given in the book 
"Hacking: The art of exploitation" by Jon Erickson.

- [getenvaddr](getenvaddr/): A program to get the addresses of env variables of
executables in a predictable way.

- [raw_tcpsniff](raw_tcpsniff/): A basic tcp sniffer implementation using raw
sockets.

- [shellcode](shellcode/): A collection of shellcodes

- [printable_helper](printable_helper/): A program to help transcribing
shellcode to printable bytes.
