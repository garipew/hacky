# hacking
This repo contains my implementations of some of the examples given in the book 
"Hacking: The art of exploitation" by Jon Erickson.

- [getenvaddr](getenvaddr/): A program to get the addresses of env variables of
executables in a predictable way.

- [raw_tcpsniff](raw_tcpsniff/): A basic tcp sniffer implementation using raw
sockets.
